**UFO Location Analysis**

**Objective:**
Setting out on this final project, we wanted to take a look at something outside of the normal realm of data analysis. 
We chose our dataset with the intent of having a bit of fun, an ultimately see how we could leverage what we've learned in an abstract way. 
Our goal in the project was to accomplish something that people have been facinated with for centuries, which is locating UFOs.
Below we have used a very large dataset that documents the various sighting over the last century. 
Our objective is to somehow use the data to not only visualize these rare occurances, but to also hopefully identify locations where these sightings happen more frequently.
